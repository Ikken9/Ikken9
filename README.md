## Hi there ðŸ‘‹! 

I'm a full-stack software developer and Software Engineering student. Enthusiastic about exploring new challenges and contributing to innovative projects.

Experienced at building robust full-stack applications. I also have done some small machine learning projects using Tensorflow and used Rust and Assembly to make some low level programming projects.
As my hobby is electronics, I'm currently carrying out some projects orientated to cybersecurity, which consist in making prototype electronic devices that serve as tools for pentesting activities. You can check 
out my pinned repos if interested.

Constantly learning and improving my skills every day!

ðŸ”­ I'm currently looking for a job!

ðŸŒ± I'm diving into cybersecurity and also learning Rust.
